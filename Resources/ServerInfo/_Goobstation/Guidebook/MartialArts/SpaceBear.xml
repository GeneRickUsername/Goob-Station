  This [textlink="martial art" link="MartialArts"] connects you to the twin spirits of Foh'Sie and Smoh'Kie. This martial art will allow the user to rampage through hordes of enemies like a true Space Bear!

  ## Special abilities

  The fire inside of these users burns hotter than the one around them, meaning they are immune to the effects of fire. The harm intent gains the aspect of claws and allows them to gain their stamina by striking the opponent.

  ## Combo attacks

  ### Bear Jaws

  ### Paw Slam

  Slam into the opponent with your paws, knocking them down. This crushes them, stunning them and slowing them down. If they are already downed, this will instead crush them even harder, while only slowing them down for less time.
