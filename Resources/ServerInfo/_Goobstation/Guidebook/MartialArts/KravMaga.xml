  Krav Maga is a self-defence style that was developed by ancient militaries on Terra six centuries ago. It can be learned
  through years of training or be given to a user by advanced nanomachines stored inside gloves. On the station, a singular
  pair of Krav Maga Gloves can be found the Warden's locker. Syndicate antagonists can use Krav Maga Implant for the same effect.

  ## Action Combat

  Krav Maga combos aren't like the combos of most martial arts. The user must instead ready the attack they
  wish to use in the action bar, then follow it up by performing Harm action on the opponent as normal.

  ### No action selected

  A regular Harm attack, however its damage would be increased, and more if the opponent is downed.

  ### Leg Sweep

  Sweeps the legs out from under an opponent to knock them down.

  ### Neck Chop

  A hard swing with the side of the user's hand temporally disables the opponent's ability to speak.

  ### Lung Punch

  Deals Stamina damage and temporally disables the opponent's ability to breath.
