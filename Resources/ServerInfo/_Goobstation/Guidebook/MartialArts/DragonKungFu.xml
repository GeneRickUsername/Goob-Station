  Dragon Kung Fu is a Shaolin style focused on defense and control. Fluid movements and powerful strikes come
  with patience and resilience. Perfect for bodyguards, it strengthens defenses and counters with precision.
  Blueshield Officers can select the manual of this martial art in their weaponry box.

  ## Special abilities

  ### Defensive Discipline

  A moment of staying still unarmed turns the warrior into a living mountain, greatly lowering
  the force of incoming melee strikes and boosting their own attacks, both armed and not.

  ## Combo attacks

  ### Dragon Claw (Disarm + Disarm)

  Deals massive Stamina damage and slows the opponent down significantly.

  ### Dragon Tail (Disarm + Grab + Harm)

  Deals Blunt and Stamina damage. Knocks the opponent down if they are standing, and applies a short stun otherwise.

  ### Dragon Strike (Disarm + Harm + Harm)

  Deals 40 damage and stuns for 2 seconds. Only works on downed opponents.
