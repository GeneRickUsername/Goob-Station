  Corporate Judo, or simply Judo, is a fighting style that focuses on restraining your opponent with more complex but
  effective moves. You will see this style most used by Security Officers, as they get access to the belts in their
  department. Harness the art and strike any tider that gets in your way. A good understanding of intents is required.

  ## Special abilities

  Judo users are better at Harm intent, as their unarmed attacks will deal extra damage to the opponent.

  ### Stunbaton Scorn

  A Judo user is unable to use stunbatons. A true master relies on technique, using the
  bodyâ€™s leverage and strength to subdue, leaving the need for electrified force behind.

  ## Combo attacks

  ### Eye Poke (Disarm + Harm)

  Blinds the opponent and blurs their vision, regardless of eye protection, and deals some Blunt damage.

  ### Judo Throw (Grab + Disarm)

  Only works on standing opponents, dealing Stamina damage, knocking then down and disarming them.

  ### Armbar (Disarm + Disarm + Grab)

  If the opponent is downed, inflicts Stamina damage, otherwise disarms them.
