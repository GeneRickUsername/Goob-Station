  Corporate Judo, or simply Judo, is a [textlink="martial art" link="MartialArts"] that focuses on restraining your opponent with more
  complex but effective moves. You will see this style most used by Security Officers, as they get access to the belts in their department.
  Harness the art and strike any tider that gets in your way. A good understanding of intents is required.

  ## Special abilities

  Judo users are better at Harm intent, as their unarmed attacks will deal extra damage to the opponent.

  ### Stunbaton Scorn

  A Judo user is unable to use stunbatons. A true master relies on technique, using the
  bodyâ€™s leverage and strength to subdue, leaving the need for electrified force behind.

  ## Combo attacks
